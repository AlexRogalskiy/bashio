## About

Bashio is an bash function library for use with Hass.io add-ons.

It contains a set of commonly used operations and can be used
to be included in add-ons to reduce code duplication across add-ons and
therefore making it easier to develop and maintain add-ons.

Main goals:

- Reduce the number of operations needed in add-ons.
- Reduce the amount of code needed in add-ons.
- Make add-on code more readable.
- Providing an trusted and tested code base.

Quicker add-on development, by allowing you to focus on the add-on logic
instead of other things.
